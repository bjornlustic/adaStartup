# Unsterificator

A simple menu bar icon that lets you toggle mono audio on/off by clicking on its icon.

### But why?

Sometimes you want to watch some video and for some reason the audio is coming from only the left or the right speaker, sometimes you want to listen to a podcast but each person's voice is to one side and you (like me) hate that, there are many reasons why this simple tool can be useful ðŸ˜ƒ

### How?

It uses the accessibility API, so it's the same as toggling mono audio on/off using the Accessibility System Preferences pane.
